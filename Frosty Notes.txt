Patch Ideas
July- "Balance Update": final major move/item/ability update, do all the balance changes written in notes, 
August- "Challenger Update:" add in new trainers, side content, randomization during Elite 4 and such. 
September- "Expanded Hoenn Update": look into adding new maps or redesigning current maps, adding more side content and exploration, Gen 7 movesets
October- "Plot Update": look into editing the story. Make a familiar yet parallel story featuring favorite characters Gen 8 Movesets
December- "Polish Update": Major balance changes, many trainer team changes, Gen 9 movesets



Balance checks 
Keep an eye on:
Lopunny- are stat opts good enough?
Gengar- is shadow tag still too strong? (Only really matters in pvp)
Audino- how the hell do we save this thing? better base stats?

Number of mons negatively affected by type changes from above goes from 13/30, mons buffed by weather changes or type changes would be 2/30
No type combos involve rock
Bug/Steel would have to be looked at balance wise
Ice/Ground aka Mamoswine would be stronger but honestly lines up with what i wanted anyways
